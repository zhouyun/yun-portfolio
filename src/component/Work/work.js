With the belief of helping more Chinese students study abroad, Palmdrive operates a platform for students who want to study abroad with who studied abroad or is studying abroad.

							In order to be known by the market, branding events were launched <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-newyear">fast and massively</HighLightOnVisible>. In this case, events for different marketing preferences were developed.
	      		</p>
