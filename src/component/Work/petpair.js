                <p>I used to have a great time with two cats and one duck that my grandma rescued from  streets.

              Before jumping into research, I started with analyzing the exercise —</p>
              <div className="display-tittle">
Millions of animals are currently in shelters and foster homes awaiting adoption. Design an experience that will help connect people looking for a new pet with the right companion for them. Help an adopter find a pet which matches their lifestyle, considering factors including breed, gender, age, temperament, and health status.</div>
          <p>
          It involves pets, shelters and adopters-to-be.

Also I categorized the audience by levels —<br/>

              1. People who are looking for a new pet to adopt. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">Doers</HighLightOnVisible><br/>
2. People who are considering to adopt from shelters or buy from breeders. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">Thinker</HighLightOnVisible><br/>
3. People who have direct interactions with pets in the past. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">Observers</HighLightOnVisible>

             <p>
               Ken and Lily adopted Coco when she was 7 months. They were categorized as my Audience #1.

              </div>
             <p>
               From Coco’s story, we know —<br/>
1. Rescued pets are not for everyone.<br/>
2. Cute cats are adopted fast.<br/>
3. A simpler tool could be used.<br/>
4. Videos are recommended.
             </p>
             <p>
               Tian and Xu bought new born Nana from a breeder. They were categorized as my Audience #2.

              </div>
             <p>
               From Nana’s story, we know —<br/>
1. Dogs have been trained for particular purpose. People who have committed to raise a dog prefer to have the dog meet their expectations.<br/>
2. Impact from social media can’t be ignored.<br/>
3. Shelters usually don’t have specific pure breed.
             </p>
             <p>
               Also some opinions were shared during the interview, those opinions are not necessarily true though—
             </p>
              <div className="display-tittle">“Old cats/dogs will never treat me as their owner.”— Ning, 25-30</div>
              <p>
                Old animals already show their true personality. A kitten/puppy can become very different years after you buy it. (Which is often the reason why they end up in shelters.)
              </p>
               <div className="display-tittle">“Shelters are shabby and narrow, pets aren’t happy there.” — Amy, 20-25
</div>
              <p>
                Pets from shelters are generally healthier because they get medical checks by professionals. Also pure breeds have more possibility to get ill because of genetic defect, which may cost a lot to cure. (Also a common reason why people give up their pets.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, adopting pets from shelters cost cheaper and adopters will have a lifetime resource from the community.

              </p>

              <div className="section-sub-title">Define the goal and metrics</div>
              <p>
                With all the findings, I set up my goals —<br/>

1. Find the pets best for them, and find the homes best for the pets. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">Audience #1</HighLightOnVisible><br/>
2. Dispel the myths, educate adopters-to-be with knowledge about shelters and shelter animals. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">Audience #2</HighLightOnVisible><br/>
3. Provide more appropriate methods for larger groups to join the community to help animals. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">Audience #3</HighLightOnVisible>
              </p>
              <p>
                
Since it will not launch soon, I won’t dig into the metrics too much. But here comes the idea— <br/>
1. Time spend on finding the match pets<br/>
2. Test on shelters and shelter animals knowledge<br/>
3. Traffic and demographics change from google analytics on this solution

              <div className="section-sub-title">Website is a more intuitive and reasonable platform </div>
              <p>
                I chose website as the platform according to my interviewers’ experience — <br/>
1. Google search help them find the shelter’s website. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">easy access</HighLightOnVisible><br/>
2. It’s a big deal, they prefer to take time sitting in front a laptop to do all the emails and research. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">high efficiency</HighLightOnVisible><br/>
3. It usually happens once in a certain period of time, they will consider the second adoption after getting really acquainted with the first one. — <HighLightOnVisible className="highlight-general">low frequency</HighLightOnVisible>

                Petpair collects and processes information from other shelters’ websites for now. Although, a website will be a perfect tool for people who want to adopt pets, an app might be a better choice for shelters if they run their organizations on Petpair, since they will use it everyday.

              <p>After entering the homepage, a notification pops up from the bottom. It gives users the welcome and points out what the website is about. It explains why the user should do it and gives the expected time of doing the questionnaire which reduces the negative emotion to take it.</p>
              <p> The questionnaire floats above the website and background greys out to allow the user focus on the questionnaire. To get the user start without feeling overwhelmed, the questionnaire has several most important questions. (What and how many questions will be decided after more research.) Each time the user selects an option, related filters are displayed and added to future search or tips are shown below. The instant interaction helps the user understand why the question exists and what to expect in the situation. All the questions should be straightforward, but if the user need some time to think and come back to the question later, s/he can use the process indicator to anchor to the question. </p>
              <p>After completing the questionnaire, the user gets a view with a loading indicator. The “processing time” gives feedback on the search progress which comforts the user. Moreover, the user can use the time to create an account and even become a subscriber. Then the user will get notification of the new pets matching his or her situation as soon as they arrive. (Because cute ones gone fast!!!)  It appears as a option with good intersions of saving the user’s time and a respect for user’s efforts on the questionnaire. Also offering the user what to expect from the registration increases the trust. The account registration flow is pretty standard.
              </p>
              <p>The user can close the view at any time. It goes back to the homepage.</p>

The user can also add more filters using the dropdown menu above. (Now it’s the user’s turn.) If the user is not sure about what filter s/he should add, s/he can click “not sure” button to take a more detailed questionnaire. Questions are sorted for different purpose: beginners, amateurs and pros. (A fuzzy search feature could be added as a list view menu in the future.) The filters allow the user to play around and save the results for the future. The user can change distance to refind the pets or change the sorting method to redisplay the pets. If there is no match or very few matches, some recommended pets are displayed since the user might be willing to compromise their filters to a certain extent.</p>
              <p> Each card shows the summary information of the pet, highlighting the characteristic. A video will be played after hovering on the pet profile picture, so the user will get a prominent idea about the shape, pattern, status of the pet. S/he can save the pet if s/he likes it.</p>
              <p>The fixed next and previous buttons allow the user to browse between pets seamlessly and easily. Instead of boring the user with chunks of words, the information is customized according to the user’s situation. It provides both why the user should chose this pet and what should be paid more attention to. Pet living location and contact information are displayed at the bottom of this page. The user can click the profile to see more about the place or check the reviews on Google Map. </p>

              <p>Same as roommates, classmates and colleagues, sharing pets are also decent options. We can have a hamster, Momo raised in our classroom, 6 year old Joe and Mike will take care of him this week, and learn more about biology and parenting. We can have a cat, Fishey raised in our office, be our therapy cat, and Ken take her home this weekend.</p>

               <div className="little-blue-blink">Let’s just keep calm and move on.</div>
               <img className="lbb" src="petpair/move-on.gif" height="120px" ></img>




    
              </p>
            </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
